 ## Aplication Functionality / Requirments
 You should develop an application with the following functionality.
 
 ### General Features
 The application should be able to handle normal mobile device events (such as receiving a phone call or having a poor network connection) in an appropriate manner. The
 application should function in at least two languages.The application should function in different orientations, providing different layouts for different orientations when
 appropriate. Fixing the orientation will not meet this criteria.
 
 ### Playing Puzzles
 Puzzles can be played. Upon completing a puzzle the user should be given a score based on their performance. Maximum marks for implementing all three scoring metrics. If a
 puzzle is interrupted upon their return the user should have the option to continue where they left off. The highscores should be retained between sessions.
 
 ### Puzzle Management
 The user should be able to choose puzzles from those available on the device, or choose to download
 individual puzzles from a list of puzzles available on the server. Downloaded information should be stored to the device so that the application can function without a network
 connection. More information about the format of data provided can be found in the Data Format section. Puzzles that have been downloaded should have separate highscores so the
 user can see how they have done with each of the tile sets.
 
 ### Coding Style
 Code should follow clear conventions concerning naming of data members and functions, and where appropriate efforts should be made to separate logic objects from presentation
 layers. You should use source control throughout your development, committing whenever an appropriate unit of work has been completed, and including an appropriate log message.
